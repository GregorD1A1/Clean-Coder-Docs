Clean Coder can create frontend pages from graphical designs or simple mockups saved as .png or .jpg files.

## How to use

1. Place your design files in the project folder.
2. Name files descriptively to reflect their content.
3. When creating a task (manually or via manager), mention the availability of design files.

This ensures the Researcher agent can locate and provide appropriate images to the next agents in the pipeline.
