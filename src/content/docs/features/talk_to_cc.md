description: Use microphone input for providing feedback by your voice
---

Speak your feedback to agents using a microphone for faster input!

## How to use

1. When prompted for input by any agent, press 'm' and then Enter.
2. Your microphone will activate, allowing you to speak your response.
3. Press Enter again to finish. Your voice will be transcribed to text and sent to the agent.

Speaking is much faster than typing!
